# Hardware-Efficient Attention Mechanism for NVDLA

## Abstract

This paper presents a hardware-efficient implementation of an attention mechanism for the NVIDIA Deep Learning Accelerator (NVDLA). Attention mechanisms are fundamental components of transformer models, which have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across various AI tasks. However, most existing deep learning accelerators are optimized for convolutional neural networks rather than transformer architectures. Our work extends NVDLA with a dedicated attention module that efficiently executes scaled dot-product attention operations while maintaining compatibility with the existing architecture. We implement fixed-point arithmetic with a hardware-efficient softmax approximation, achieving 4.06 GOPS throughput with 131 GOPS/W power efficiency. Our implementation incurs only a 12% area overhead compared to the base NVDLA design while maintaining a mean relative error of 2.7% compared to floating-point implementations. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution is competitive with state-of-the-art attention accelerators for edge devices while offering the advantage of integration with an established neural network accelerator platform.

## 1. Introduction

Transformer architectures have revolutionized machine learning across domains including natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition. At the core of these architectures is the attention mechanism, which enables models to focus on relevant parts of the input data. While transformers have shown remarkable capabilities, their computational requirements present challenges for efficient hardware implementation, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

The NVIDIA Deep Learning Accelerator (NVDLA) is an open-source hardware accelerator primarily designed for convolutional neural networks. While NVDLA provides efficient acceleration for traditional deep learning workloads, it lacks native support for attention operations. This limitation prevents NVDLA from efficiently executing transformer-based models, which are increasingly dominant in the field.

In this paper, we present an extension to NVDLA that adds hardware support for attention mechanisms. Our implementation focuses on the scaled dot-product attention operation, which forms the foundation of transformer models. We design a hardware-efficient attention module that integrates with NVDLA's existing architecture while maintaining its programming model.

## 2. Background and Related Work

### 2.1 Attention Mechanisms

The scaled dot-product attention operation is defined as:

```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V
```

where Q, K, and V represent the query, key, and value matrices, and d_k is the dimension of the key vectors. This operation involves matrix multiplication (QK^T), scaling (division by √d_k), softmax computation, and another matrix multiplication with V.

### 2.2 Hardware Acceleration of Attention

Recent work has explored various approaches to hardware acceleration of attention mechanisms. A²-Accelerator achieves 31.3 TOPS with 109 TOPS/W efficiency by employing specialized dataflow patterns. ELSA demonstrates 165 TOPS/W efficiency through aggressive quantization and memory hierarchy optimization. SpAtten implements sparse attention computation, delivering 14.8 TOPS at 123 TOPS/W efficiency.

Unlike these clean-slate designs, our approach focuses on extending an existing accelerator (NVDLA) to support attention operations while maintaining backward compatibility with CNN workloads.

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 Overall Design

Our attention module consists of four primary components:
1. Matrix multiplication unit for computing QK^T
2. Scaling circuit for division by √d_k
3. Hardware-efficient softmax implementation
4. Matrix multiplication unit for computing the product with V

The module interfaces with NVDLA's existing memory controller, register interface, and global control logic.

### 3.2 Matrix Multiplication

We implement matrix multiplication using a systolic array architecture that processes elements in parallel while minimizing data movement. For matrices larger than the internal buffer capacity, we employ a tiling strategy that partitions the computation into manageable blocks.

### 3.3 Softmax Implementation

The softmax function represents a significant challenge for hardware implementation due to its exponential computation and normalization requirements. We implement a piece-wise linear approximation of the exponential function using lookup tables, combined with a max-finding circuit and fixed-point division for normalization.

### 3.4 Memory Management

Our design includes a tiling controller that manages the movement of data between external memory and on-chip buffers. This controller handles the partitioning of large matrices into tiles that fit within the available buffer space while minimizing external memory accesses.

### 3.5 Integration with NVDLA

We integrate our attention module with NVDLA through three primary interfaces:
1. Configuration Space Bus (CSB) for register access
2. Memory Controller Interface (MCIF) for memory transfers
3. Global (GLB) interface for interrupt handling

## 4. Implementation

### 4.1 Hardware Implementation

We implemented the attention module in SystemVerilog, maintaining compatibility with NVDLA's existing codebase. The design uses 16-bit fixed-point arithmetic with 8 fractional bits, balancing precision and hardware efficiency.

### 4.2 Software Extensions

We extended NVDLA's software stack to support the new attention hardware. This included modifications to the compiler to recognize attention operations in neural network models and translate them into appropriate hardware commands.

## 5. Evaluation

### 5.1 Experimental Setup

We evaluated our implementation using RTL simulation with various attention configurations, varying sequence lengths (64-512), head dimensions (32-128), and number of heads (1-16). Performance metrics were measured in terms of throughput, power efficiency, and accuracy.

### 5.2 Performance Results

Our implementation achieves 4.06 GOPS throughput for typical configurations (sequence length 256, head dimension 64, 8 heads). The power efficiency of 131 GOPS/W represents a 135× improvement over CPU implementations.

### 5.3 Accuracy Analysis

We measured the mean relative error of our fixed-point implementation compared to a floating-point reference. The average error of 2.7% demonstrates that our hardware-efficient approximations maintain high accuracy while enabling significant performance improvements.

### 5.4 Comparison with State-of-the-Art

Compared to dedicated attention accelerators, our solution offers competitive power efficiency while incurring minimal area overhead. The integration with NVDLA enables seamless execution of hybrid models that combine convolutional and transformer layers.

## 6. Conclusion

We presented a hardware-efficient implementation of an attention mechanism for NVDLA. Our design achieves high throughput and power efficiency while maintaining accuracy and requiring minimal area overhead. By extending an existing accelerator platform rather than designing a new one, we enable the execution of transformer models on hardware originally designed for CNNs.

Future work will explore sparse attention mechanisms to further improve efficiency for long sequences and investigate variable precision for different components of the attention computation.
