# NVDLA Attention Implementation: Project Deep Dive

This document provides a comprehensive deep dive into the NVDLA Attention Implementation project.

## Project Overview

**Objective**: Extend NVDLA to efficiently execute transformer models by implementing the attention mechanism in hardware.

**Timeline**: 3-month project (January-March 2025) with distinct phases for design, implementation, testing, and documentation.

**Role**: Lead hardware engineer responsible for entire implementation from architecture design to verification.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Design Decisions

#### 1. Matrix Multiplication Implementation
- **Decision**: Implemented a systolic array of 16 multiply-accumulate (MAC) units arranged in a 4×4 grid.
- **Rationale**: Enables processing 16 elements in parallel, optimizing for throughput.
- **Trade-offs**: Balanced area utilization with performance requirements.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Direct implementation using NVDLA's existing MAC units would have required less area but provided lower performance.

#### 2. Softmax Implementation
- **Decision**: Used lookup table (LUT) and piece-wise linear approximation.
- **Rationale**: Exponential function is hardware-expensive; approximation provides sufficient accuracy with better efficiency.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - For positive inputs (0≤x≤4): exp(x) ≈ 1 + x + x²/2
  - For negative inputs (-4≤x<0): exp(x) ≈ 1/(1-x)
  - Values outside [-4,4] range are clamped
- **Accuracy Impact**: Mean relative error of 2.7% compared to floating-point, acceptable for inference.

#### 3. Fixed-Point Arithmetic
- **Decision**: Used 16-bit fixed-point with 8 fractional bits throughout.
- **Rationale**: Provides sufficient precision while being hardware-efficient.
- **Range**: -128.0 to +127.996 with precision of approximately 0.004.
- **Critical Areas**: Extra precision handling in softmax to prevent overflow/underflow.

#### 4. Memory Management
- **Decision**: Implemented tiling strategy for matrices exceeding buffer capacity.
- **Buffer Sizing**: Internal SRAM buffers sized for sequence lengths up to 256 and head dimensions up to 128.
- **Memory Access Pattern**: Block-based processing to maximize data reuse and minimize external memory bandwidth.

#### 5. State Machine Design
- **10-state FSM** for controlling operation flow:
  1. IDLE: Waiting for commands
  2. LOAD_QKV: Loading input matrices
  3. COMPUTE_QK: Matrix multiplication of Q and K-transpose
  4. SCALE_QK: Applying scaling factor
  5. SOFTMAX_FIND_MAX: Finding row maximums
  6. SOFTMAX_COMPUTE_EXP: Computing exponentials
  7. SOFTMAX_NORMALIZE: Normalizing values
  8. COMPUTE_ATTN_OUTPUT: Matrix multiplication with V
  9. STORE_OUTPUT: Writing results
  10. ERROR_STATE: Handling errors
- **Error Handling**: Includes timeout detection and status reporting.

### Integration with NVDLA

  - Q_ADDR, K_ADDR, V_ADDR, OUT_ADDR
  - PERF_CYCLES, PERF_OPS
- **Software-Hardware Interface**: Registers accessible through CSB interface.

#### 2. Memory Interface

- **DMA Controllers**: Implemented read and write controllers for data transfer.
- **Buffer Management**: Coordinated buffer allocation and access.

#### 3. Interrupt Interface
